jQuery Image Border Plugin v0.1
---------------------------------

The purpose of this plugin is to create a CSS3 curved border for the images.
This can easily be done using CSS3 coding but there are some situations where it will be great using a jQuery plugin for selected images and apply
this border dynamically.

I have created this plugin to improve my skills on jQuery to develop jQuery Plugins. By the way, this is my first jQuery Plugin

For example, please see index.html

Thanks
